The classification model in this repository aims to identify the species of trees based on physical characteristics.
such as leaf width, leaf length, leaf area, length-to-width ratio, number of leaves on the rachis, and length of the rachis.
It is built using a deep neural network architecture implemented in TensorFlow/Keras.
